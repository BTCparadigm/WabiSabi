\section{Introduction}

% TODO: what's mainly missing from the current description of #17 is context and motivation
% as such we should probably define the sort of high level idea of collaborative transaction construction, briefly reviewing the coinjoin security model

Wasabi currently applies a Chaumian CoinJoin protocol~\cite{chaum1983blind} using Schnorr blind signatures. We propose to switch to a Keyed-Verification Anonymous Credentials-based (KVAC) scheme~\cite{chase2019signal}. We call this new scheme WabiSabi.

\section{Motivation}
The present protocol used in Wasabi imposes many usability frictions and challenges. In this work we are aiming to solve the following problems:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Ideally, users should be able to issue payments in a CoinJoin. 
    \item Since payments currently are not possible, many change UTXO do not have any "added value" in a CoinJoin transaction. This might change if they can be used to settle payments. This is also beneficial for the blockchain as less block space would be used. 
    \item In the current protocol input registration links the user's inputs, as well as their change output.
\end{itemize}

% brief explanation of why coinjoins are desirable:
% - privacy
% - fungibility
% - theoretically transaction efficiency
% and overview of where zerolink/wasabi currently falls short (variable but constrained denomination, only send to self, linkage of inputs during registration, 

\section{Protocol Overview}

\subsection{Roles}
In this protocol we have three roles Alice, Bob and the coordinator.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Alice registers her input UTXO(s). There are multiple such Alices.
    \item ``Bob'', a pseudonym of Alice, used for registering an output with a different network identifier. Alice can have several such pseudonyms.
    \item The coordinator, which facilitates the protocol. The protocol's main goal is to maintain privacy against coordinator.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Terminology and notations}

\begin{definition}(Input)
Confirmed UTXOs the user wants to register for the subsequent CoinJoin transaction. For this section we represent inputs only in terms of their satoshi amount (integer), ignoring details like proving ownership.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}(Output)
Desired transaction output that the user wishes to construct without linking to their inputs. Similarly to inputs, we represent outputs only in terms of their satoshi amounts, ignoring details like the \texttt{scriptPubKey}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}(Credential)
A credential is issued by the coordinator at input registration, and covers attributes certified by the coordinator. The user can then prove possession of a valid credential in zero-knowledge in order to register an output without the coordinator being able to link it to input registration.

We use the key verifiable anonymous credential scheme from in~\cite{chase2019signal}, instantiated with two group attributes (attributes whose value is an element of the underlying group) as described above.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}(Attributes)
In this work we require two attributes: $M_v$ is a commitment to the amount of the registered input denominated in satoshis and $M_s$ is a commitment to a serial number used for double spending prevention.

During credential presentation randomized versions of the attributes are presented, which we denote $C_v$ and $C_s$.
\end{definition}

Finally, let $k$ be a protocol level constant, denoting the number of credentials used in input and output registration requests.

\subsection{Input Registration} 

Alice submits her input of value $v_{\mathrm{in}}$ along with $k$ pairs of group attributes,
$(M_{v_i}, M_{s_i})$.
She proves in zero knowledge that the sum of the requested sub-amounts is equal to $v_{\mathrm{in}}$ and that the individual amounts are positive integers in the allowed range.

% TODO decide if we want additional input credentials if we go with OR proof variant
% open questions:
% - single pedersen multicommitment for amount and serial or two separate group attributes?
% - if separate, extra generator + randomness for unconditional hiding of serial number even after revealing serial?

The coordinator verifies the proofs, and issues $k$ MACs on the requested attributes, along with a proof of knowledge of the secret key as described in \textit{Credential Issuance} protocol of \cite{chase2019signal}.

\subsection{Output Registration}

To register her output Alice generates randomized commitments to the attributes and a proof of knowledge of a valid credential issued by the coordinator.

Additionally, she proves knowledge of representation of the serial number commitments. These serial numbers are revealed for double spending protection, but the knowledge of commitment opening should be done in zero knowledge to avoid revealing the randomness of the original commitment in the input registration phase or the randomization added in output registration time.

Finally, Alice proves that the sum of the randomized amount attributes $C_v$ matches the requested output amount $v_{\mathrm{out}}$, analogously to input registration. Note that there is no need for range proofs at this phase.

The user submits these proofs, the randomized attributes, and the serial numbers. The coordinator verifies the proofs, and if it accepts the output will be included in the transaction.

\subsection{Signing phase}
The coordinator sends out the final unsigned transaction to the different Alices who will sign if they see their registered output included in the transaction.

\section{Protocol Details}

Following \cite{chase2019signal}, the scheme is defined in a group \(\mathbb{G}\) of prime order \(q,\) written in multiplicative notation.

We require the following fixed set of group elements:
\[
G_{w}, G_{w^{\prime}}, G_{x_{0}}, G_{x_{1}},
G_{v}, G_{s}, G_g, G_h,
G_{V}.
\]

This notation deviates slightly from \cite{chase2019signal}, in that we subscript the attribute generators $G_{y_i}$ as $G_v$ and $G_s$ instead of using numerical indices, and we require two additional generators $G_g$ and $G_h$ for constructing the attributes $M_v$ and $M_s$ as Pedersen commitments.

We assume that all generator points used throughout the protocol are generated in a way that nobody knows the discrete logarithms between any pair of them.

As with the generators we denote the secret key
\( \mathrm{sk} := \left(w, w^{\prime}, x_{0}, x_{1},y_{v}, y_{s}\right) \).

The issuer parameters \textit{iparams}
\( \left(C_{W}, I\right) \)
are computed as:
\[
C_{W}={G_w}^{w} {G_{w^\prime}}^{w^\prime},
I=\frac{G_{V}}{{G_{x_0}}^{x_0} {G_{x_1}}^{x_1} {G_{y_v}}^{y_v} {G_{y_s}}^{y_s}}
\]



\subsection{Input Registration}

Alice wants to register an input UTXO with value $v_{\mathit{in}}$, broken into sub-amounts $v_i$ where $i \in \left[1,k\right]$.
She submits amount and serial commitments:
\[ \forall i \in \left[1,k\right]: M_{v_i}={G_g}^{r_{v_i}}{G_h}^{v_i} \]
\[ \forall i \in \left[1,k\right]: M_{s_i}={G_g}^{r_{s_i}}{G_h}^{s_i} \]

For each amount she includes a range proof:
\[
\pi^{\mathit{range}}_i := \operatorname{PK}\left\{\left(v_i, r_{v_i} \right) :
M_{v_i} = {G_g}^{r_{v_i}}{G_h}^{v_i}
\wedge
0 \leq v_i < v_{\mathit{max}} \right\}
\]

Finally, Alice also needs to convince the coordinator that the sent amount commitments add up to the registered input UTXO value, hence she sends the following proof:
\[ \pi^{\mathit{sum}}=\sum_{i=1}^{k} r_{v_i} \]

The coordinator can then calculate the product of the amount commitments and check:

\[ \prod_{i=1}^{k} M_{v_i}
\stackrel{?}{=}
{G_g}^{\pi^{\mathit{sum}}}{G_h}^{v_{\mathit{in}}}
\]

Note that this equality over the product of commitments implies the sum is correct:
\[\prod_{i=1}^{k} M_{v_i}
= G_h^{\sum_{i=1}^{k} v_i} G_g^{\sum_{i=1}^{k} r_{v_i}}
\iff
\sum_{i=1}^{k} v_i = v_{\mathit{in}}
\]

If the coordinator accepts it issues the credentials by responding with a MAC
$(t_i, U_i, V_i) \in \mathbb{Z}_q \times \mathbb{G} \times \mathbb{G}$ for each credential
where
$t_i \in_{R} \mathbb{Z}_{q}, U_i \in_{R} \mathbb{G}$
and
\[
V_i=W {U_i}^{x_{0}+x_{1} t_i}{M_{v_i}}^{y_v} {M_{s_i}}^{y_s}
\]

To avoid tagging of the user, the coordinator must also prove knowledge of the secret key, and that \( (t, U, V) \) is correct relative to \textit{iparams} \( =\left(C_{W}, I\right) \) with the following proof of knowledge:
% TODO rephrase this a little so it's not plagiarism

\begin{align*}
\pi_{i}^{\mathit{iparams}}=\operatorname{PK}\{ & (w, w^{\prime}, x_{0}, x_{1}, y_v, y_s): \\
&C_{W}={G_{w}}^{w} {G_{w^{\prime}}}^{w^\prime} \wedge \\
&I=\frac{G_{V}}{{G_{x_{0}}}^{x_0} {G_{x_1}}^{x_1} {G_{y_v}}^{y_v} {G_{y_s}}^{y_s}} \wedge \\
&V_i={G_w}^{w}{U_i}^{x_{0}+x_{1}t_i} M_v M_s
\}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Output Registration}

After the input registration ``Bob'' (Alice's pseudonym) may have up to $t$ credentials from all of her input registration requests.
Let $S \subseteq \left[1,t\right]$ be the indices of credentials that a user wants to consolidate into a single output registration.

\subsubsection{Over-spending prevention by proving sum of amounts}

``Bob'' randomizes her amount commitments with $z_{i}\in_{R} \mathbb{Z}_q$:
\[ \forall i \in S: C_{v_i}={G_v}^{z_i} M_{v_i} = {G_v}^{z_i}{G_g}^{r_{v_i}}{G_h}^{v_i} \]

The product of randomized commitments amounts to:

\[\prod_{i \in S} C_{{v_i}}
= \prod_{i \in S} {G_v}^{z_i}M_{v_i}
= {G_v}^{\sum_{i \in S} z_i}{G_g}^{\sum_{i \in S} r_{v_i}}{G_h}^{\sum_{i \in S} v_i}
\]

Therefore we can obtain a zero-knowledge proof for the sum of the committed values $v_i$ in the randomized commitments:

\[ \pi^{v_{out}}=\left(\sum_{i \in S}z_i,\sum_{i \in S}r_{v_i}\right) \]

coordinator checks whether
\[
\prod_{i \in S} C_{v_i}
\stackrel{?}{=}
{G_v}^{\pi^{v_{out}}[1]} {G_g}^{\pi^{v_{out}}[2]} {G_h}^{v_{\mathit{out}}}
\]

The coordinator can compute the right hand side of the verification equation, since she obtained the exponents of each of the generator points from the submitted $\pi^{v_{out}}$. Informally soundness of the proof system holds as user does not know the discrete logs between the generator points used in the randomized commitments. While zero-knowledge is ensured since $\sum_{i \in S}z_i$ does not leak anything about individual $z_i$. We can have a similar argument for $\sum_{i \in S}r_{v_i}$ and $r_{v_i}$.

% we should assign variable names to the symbols because sums in the exponents look really ugly now that i generalized from 2

\subsubsection{Double-spending prevention by revealing serial numbers}

``Bob'' randomizes her serial number commitments:

\[ \forall i \in S: C_{{s_i}}={G_s}^{z_i}M_{s_i}={G_s}^{z_i}{G_g}^{r_{s_i}}{G_h}^{s_i} \]

``Bob'' proves knowledge of representation of her submitted randomized serial number commitments, namely:

\[
\pi_{i}^{\mathit{serial}}=\operatorname{PK}\{ (s_i, z_i, r_{s_i}):C_{s_i} = {G_s}^{z_i}{G_g}^{r_{s_i}}{G_h}^{s_i}
\}
\]
where the serial number $s_i$ is a public input.

However, Bob reveals her serial numbers $s_i$ to prevent double-spending:
\[ \forall i \in S: \pi_i=\frac{C_{{s_i}}}{{G_h}^{s_i}} = {G_s}^{z_i} {G_g}^{r_{s_i}} \]
% FIXME: also need to prove knowledge of z_i and r_{s_i} of terms of this product's factors WRT $g$ and $G_{y_s}$

coordinator checks whether \[ \forall i \in S: {G_h}^{s_i} \pi_i = C_{s_i} \]

and that the $s_i$ have not been used before (but allowing for idempotent output registration).

Note that after revealing $s_i$, we no longer have perfect hiding in the $M_{s_i}$ commitment, since, because there is exactly one $r_{s_i} \in \mathbb{Z}_q$ such that $M_{s_i} = {G_g}^{r_{s_i}} {G_h}^{s_i}$. To preserve user privacy in case of a crypto break we can add another randomness term with an additional generator to the the serial number commitment.

For each credential $i \in S$ ``Bob'' executes the $\mathsf{Show}$ protocol as in~\cite{chase2019signal}:

\begin{enumerate}

\item She chooses
$z_i \in_{R} \mathbb{Z}_{q}$,
and computes 
$z_{0_i}=-{t_i} {z_i} (\bmod q)$
and the commitments:

\begin{align*}
C_{v_i}     &= {G_v}^{z_i} M_{v_i} \\
C_{s_i}     &= {G_s}^{z_i} M_{s_i} \\
C_{x_{0_i}} &= {G_{x_0}}^{z_i} {U_i} \\
C_{x_{1_i}} &= {G_{x_1}}^{z_i} {U_i}^{t_i} \\
C_{V_i}     &= {G_V}^{z_i} V \\
\end{align*}


\item To prove to the coordinator that she is in posession of a valid MAC on her amount and serial number commitments, ``Bob'' computes the following proof of knowledge:
\begin{align*}
\pi_{i}^{\mathit{MAC}}=\operatorname{PK}\{
& (z_i, z_{0_i},t_i): \\
& Z_i =I^{z_i} \land \\ %% does this proof need to say anything about C_{m_i} or C_{s_i} or is this statement about Z enough?
& C_{x_{1_i}} = {C_{x_{0_i}}}^{t_i} {G_{x_0}}^{z_{0_i}} {G_{x_1}}^{z_i}\}
\end{align*}
%% if we go with OR proof, then \lor M_{v_i} = {G_g}^{r_{v_i}} {G_h}^0
\end{enumerate}

%%% already part of the verifier output

Finally, ``Bob'' sends $(C_{x_{0_i}}, C_{x_{1_i}}, C_{V_i}, C_{v_i} C_{s_i} \pi_i^{\mathit{MAC}})$ to the coordinator, who computes:
\[
Z_i=\frac{C_{V_i}}{W {C_{x_{0_i}}}^{x_0} {C_{x_{1_i}}}^{x_{1}}
{C_{v_i}}^{y_v} {C_{s_i}}^{y_s} %%% FIXME WTF WTF is this even correct?
}
\]
using the secret key $(W, x_{0}, x_{1}, y_v, y_s)$ and verifies $\pi_i^{\mathit{MAC}}$.

% note Z_i is calculated independently by ``Bob'' and the coordinator
